This plugin was first written by Emanuele Rocca, but it was recently rewritten
so that it now works with the new panel API. It allows you to send requests
directly to your browser and perform a custom search. Some examples:
http://www.google.it/search?q= if you want to perform a search on Google or
http://bugs.debian.org if something is wrong with your system (assuming your
distribution is Debian).
