xfce4-panel is the panel of the XFce Desktop Environment. It is modeled
slightly after the CDE panel and, of course, previous versions of xfce. The
panel provides program lauchers, detachable, non-hierarchical menus (easier to
read at a glance), and several panel 'plugins' like a clock and a pager.
Additional plugins may be installed separately.
