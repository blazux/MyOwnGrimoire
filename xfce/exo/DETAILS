libexo is an extension library for Xfce. While Xfce ships with quite a few
libraries that are primarly targeted at desktop development, libexo is targeted
at application development, with a focus on applications for Xfce. It contains
several additional widgets (e.g. an icon bar and widgets that automatically
ellipsize text), provides a framework for editable toolbars, light-weight
session management support, functions to automatically synchronize object
properties, and several miscelleanous utility and helper functions useful for
application developers.
