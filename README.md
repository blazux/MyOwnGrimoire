## MyOwnGrimoire

Some XFCE updates for the Source Mage "test" grimoire. 

Use at your own risk.

### Some Details : 

- libxfce4menu, libxfcegui4 have been removed, they're deprecated
- notification-daemon-xfce not needed anymore and libsexy won't cast
- xfce-utils, xfce4-iconbox, xfce4-mixer pretty old and useless as far as I know
- thunar-vfs removed as well, deprecated too
- squeeze has a thunar-vfs dependency, I don't know yet if gvfs would do the job

- updated dependency for xfwm4 and ristretto
- updated version for almost everything else
- removed all gpg sig
- added sha hash when it was missing
